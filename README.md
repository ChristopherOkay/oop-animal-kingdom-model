# oop-animal-kingdom-model
Modeling the Animal kingdom as a class. Applying all four principles of OOP.
The following sites are where I researched the information used in the development of this project
+ [Animal Kingdom](https://byjus.com/biology/animal-kingdom/)
+ [Picture Template](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Animal-Kingdom-Classification-of-Animal-Kingdom.png)
+ [Learning Material for the codes](https://www.genesystechhub.com/learnable)


# Usage
clone the repo and cd into the directory such that you are on oop-animal-kingdom-model
To run the solution, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
use the following command terminal
```
# run animal.js
node animal.js
```

# Sample Output

+ If the animal.js is run successfully, the results would look like:

```
